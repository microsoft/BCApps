## ⚠️ Stale Status Check Deleted

The **Pull Request Build** workflow run for this PR was older than **$thresholdHours hours** and has been deleted.

### 📋 Why was it deleted?

Status checks that are too old may no longer reflect the current state of the target branch. To ensure this PR is validated against the latest code and passes up-to-date checks, a fresh build is required.

---

### 🔄 How to trigger a new status check:

1. 📤 **Push a new commit** to the PR branch, or
2. 🔁 **Close and reopen** the PR

This will automatically trigger a new **Pull Request Build** workflow run.
